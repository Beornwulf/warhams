<h3>Hello Friend</h3>
<p>Go into BattleScribe, and click either "Save as HTML" or "Save Roster":</p>
<img src="butan.png" alt="BattleScribe Save and Save as HTML buttons" width="300px"/>

<p>Then put the HTML/ROS/ROSZ file here and wait for a little bit (30 seconds, tops, unless you're a dick and tried a 12,000 point Apoc list, in which case what the fuck):</p>
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/post.php">
<input type="file" name="list">
<input type="submit" value="pres">
</form>

<p>And you should get something like this:</p>

<p>Ping me on the forums or in 40k Discord if that either doesn't give you a PDF or it gives you one that's all fucked up. Namaste.</p>
